# VulnerabilitiesAssessmentReport

1. Artemis financial was a client who needed the security of their web application assessed. 
2. I uncovered lots of vulnerabilities in their code base, including a lack of adequate encryption and input verification. This left the program vulnerable to different attacks and user data being stolen. 
3. The assessment was challenging, mainly due to the fact that the application we looked at was very small. There wasnt very much code to actually read through, so I wasn't exactly sure how to address it.
4. I suggested adding SHA-256 for this application as it housed sensitive financial information. 
5. I checked the code for vulnerabilites throughout the refactoring to ensrue no new vulnerabilites were being added. 
6. I also used external tools, such as maven dependancy check, to look for vulnerabilites.
7. This assignment may help to show my competency in being able to address security concerns when writing or planning code.
